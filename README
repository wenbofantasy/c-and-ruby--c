This git repositories is about the exercises of C and ruby program language. The questions are extracted from a book called
<<C程序设计题解与上机指导>>, and from the name of each file which the file extention is "c", you could understand how to correspond 
each exercise here to the one in the book, For example, the file 4.8.c in this git repository corresponds to exercise chapter 4 section 8 in the book.
And the exercise will be solved in both c language and ruby language, in this way I believe that this git repository could improve my both C programming skill and Ruby programming skill.
Actually, there is a great textbook called << C程序设计 >>, which authored by 谭浩强. This book is good material to learn C program language,
and I dare to say in China everyone that familiar with C or even just heard of it must know this book. Tell you what, I just heard about this book two month ago.
